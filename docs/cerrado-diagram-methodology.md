# The "Cerrado Diagram" (Diagrama de Cerrado) Investment Methodology

## What is the Cerrado Diagram Methodology?

The "Cerrado Diagram" (Diagrama de Cerrado) is an investment methodology created by "Investidor Sardinha" to systematize the process of selecting and managing assets in an investment portfolio. It acts as a decision-making framework that helps investors choose which assets to buy, when to buy them, and how much to allocate to each, aiming to reduce risk and optimize returns. The system is designed to be a logical and data-driven approach, removing emotional bias from investment decisions.

## Key Principles

The methodology is built on a foundation of several key principles:

1.  **Strategic Asset Allocation:** The first step is to define a target allocation for different asset classes based on the investor's risk profile and financial goals. For example, an investor might decide on a portfolio composition of:
    *   35% in Fixed Income
    *   25% in Variable Income (Stocks, etc.)
    *   20% in Currencies (e.g., USD)
    *   20% in Foreign Assets (e.g., REITs, ETFs)

2.  **Portfolio Rebalancing:** The system signals which assets to invest in based on the current portfolio allocation versus the target allocation. The goal is to buy assets that are "under-allocated" in the portfolio, which often means buying assets that have depreciated in value, thus buying low.

3.  **Risk Management:** By diversifying across different asset classes and applying a systematic approach to buying and selling, the methodology aims to reduce the overall risk of the portfolio.

4.  **Quantitative Analysis:** The selection of individual assets is based on a set of quantitative criteria, which are used to score and rank potential investments.

## How it Works for Investment Decision-Making

The Cerrado Diagram works as a step-by-step guide for making investment decisions:

1.  **Define Target Allocation:** The investor sets the desired percentage for each asset class in their portfolio.
2.  **Analyze Current Portfolio:** The investor compares their current portfolio allocation to the target allocation.
3.  **Identify Under-Allocated Assets:** The system identifies which asset classes are below their target percentage.
4.  **Select Assets within the Class:** Once the asset class is identified (e.g., REITs), the investor uses the specific criteria of the Cerrado Diagram to select the best individual assets within that class.
5.  **Execute the Investment:** The investor then proceeds to buy the selected asset.

This process is repeated regularly (e.g., monthly) to ensure the portfolio remains balanced according to the investor's strategy.

## Criteria for Asset Selection

The methodology uses a specific set of criteria to evaluate and score assets. The criteria for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs/FIIs) are:

*   **Location:** Are the fund's properties located in prime, desirable regions?
*   **Property Quality:** Are the properties new and without excessive maintenance costs?
*   **Valuation (P/VP):** Is the fund trading below a Price-to-Book Value (P/VP) of 1? (A P/VP above 1.5 is a disqualifying factor).
*   **Dividend Yield:** Is the dividend yield within or above the average for similar funds in the same sector?
*   **Diversification:** Does the fund have a diversified portfolio of tenants and properties, avoiding concentration risk?
*   **Consistency:** Has the fund consistently distributed dividends for more than four years?

## How it Applies to Different Asset Types

While the specific criteria provided are for REITs/FIIs, the underlying principles of the Cerrado Diagram can be adapted for other asset classes:

*   **Stocks:** For stocks, the criteria would likely be adapted to include metrics like P/E ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, revenue growth, profitability margins, and dividend history.
*   **ETFs:** For ETFs, the analysis might focus on the expense ratio, the underlying index, tracking error, and the diversification of the ETF's holdings.
*   **Fixed Income:** For fixed-income assets, the criteria would shift to credit quality (ratings), yield to maturity, and duration.

The core idea remains the same: define a set of objective criteria to evaluate and compare assets within the same class.

## Specific Rules or Formulas Mentioned

*   **P/VP Rule for REITs/FIIs:** A Price-to-Book Value (P/VP) ratio above **1.5** is a strict disqualifier for a REIT/FII. The ideal is to buy below a P/VP of 1.
*   **Scoring System:** A scoring system is used where a point is subtracted for each criterion that is not met. This allows for a quantitative comparison between different assets, helping the investor to choose the one with the highest score.
